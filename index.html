<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>JumpCutter detects frames with silence and automatically removes them. It also<br>detects when you're clapping and takes a frame at thet moment.</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to use it by yourself, complete the following steps:</p>
<div>
	<li>1. Download and install <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3.7</a></li>
	<li>2. Download JumpCutter.</li>
	<li>3. Open "install-requirements.bat".</li>
	<p>You're done!</p>
</div>
<br>
<h1>How to use</h1>
<div>
	<li>1. Open CMD by typing "cmd" in the search bar.</li>
	<li>2. Type "cd (JumpCutter directory)".</li>
	<li>3. Type "jumpcutter.py --input_file (filename) --output_file (filename).</li>
	<p>Additional options:</p>
	<p>If you want to edit a video with a different frame rate (e.g. 24 or 60 fps), then<br>type "--frame_rate (frame rate)" to the end of the line.</p>
	<p>If you want to make silent fragments to play at a different speed (e.g. 3x or 10x), then<br>type "--silent_speed (silent speed with .00 at the end, e.g. 5.00)" to the end of the line.</p>
	<p>If you want to edit a video with a different sample rate (e.g. 36000 Hz), then<br>type "--sample_rate (sample rate)" to the end of the line.</p>
	<p>If you want to set the volume amount that frames' audio needs to surpass to be consider<br>"sounded" (it ranges from 0 (silence) to 1 (max volume)), then type "--silent_threshold (silent threshold)" to the end of the line.</p>
	<p>If you want to make sounded fragments to play at a different speed (e.g. 2x or 3x), then<br>type "--sounded_speed (sounded speed with .00 at the end, e.g. 2.00)" to the end of the line.</p>
	<p>If you want to edit a video with a different frame margin (e.g. 2 or 3), then<br>type "--frame_margin (frame margin)" to the end of the line.</p>
	<p>If you want to set the quality of frames to be extracted from input video (1 is highest, 31 is lowest), then<br>type "--frame_quality (frame quality)" to the end of the line.</p>
